# Mario Kart Tracker

Made with `React`, `Redux`, `Typescript`, `HTML` and `CSS`.

## About

- This is a project that came up with my friends while we were
  planning to do all the 96 circuits in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,
  including all the ones from the Booster Course Pass. Since the
  game doesn't allow to do a 96 circuit cup (and doesn't allow more
  than 4 players on a single Switch), I thought it would be a good
  idea to create a whole app to track the scores of everyone, even
  if we have to take a break and things like that.
- While it works just as fine, there might be a few errors and
  things that I didn't take into consideration, such as the fact
  that you can create as many profiles as you like, allow more than
  12 players in a single game and so on (upsie ðŸ˜…). I fixed (almost)
  everything that I could think of, but there might be some things
  that are not fixed yet.
- With that said, if this app somehow gains popularity, I'll
  definitely fix everything for it to be flawless. But now, for my
  friends and I, it works just as fine ðŸ™‚
- Speaking of which, every other game besides Mario Kart 8 Deluxe +
  DLC is missing. So, right now, if you select a game, no matter
  which one, the available circuits will be from the mentioned game.
- In the latest game, every character from the main series except 4
  are playable. The ones that are missing are Donkey Kong Jr.,
  Paratroopa, R.O.B and Honey Queen. They can't be selected in this
  app because the icons for the 4 remaining characters wouldn't
  look as nice as the other ones ðŸ¥²
- This is intended to be used with a laptop or a tablet, not with a
  phone, but I did my best ðŸ˜Ž
- Speaking of which, every other game besides Mario Kart 8 Deluxe +
  DLC is missing. So, right now, if you select a game, no matter
  which one, the available circuits will be from MK8.
